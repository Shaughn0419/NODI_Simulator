# P16 Closure Review Record Schema

Required verdict: `NO P16 BLOCKERS FOUND`.

Required decision: `p16_closed_no_blockers_no_scope_expansion`.

The record binds the P16 solver output manifest and P16 artifact manifest by path and sha256. It is closure evidence only and does not authorize additional solver execution.

Required guards:
